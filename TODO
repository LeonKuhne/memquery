MemQuery
========
* create a sparse sample algo that dumps random memory points into a time series database (eg influxdb), with hopes of constructing a decently acturate picture over time without interupting the target process
* analyze/query/visualize (eg graphana) the time series data to find relevant memory addresses 
* clean up this stupid file structure

Current
=======
* option: whether to search in readonly regions
* reduce memory consumption (e.g. OVaMI padding)

* see: https://github.com/scanmem/scanmem/issues for further TODOs

Future
======
* use PT_IO on freebsd, instead of PT_READ/WRITE_D
* add working freebsd support
* in targetmem.c, check return value of allocate_enough_to_reach everywhere
* search for values in files? (eg saved state)
* macro support
* automatically support zero and one based values.
